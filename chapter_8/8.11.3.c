/*Write a program that reads input as a stream of characters until encountering EOF.
Have it report the number of uppercase letters, the number of lowercase letters, and the
number of other characters in the input. You may assume that the numeric values for the
lowercase letters are sequential and assume the same for uppercase. Or, more portably,
you can use appropriate classification functions from the ctype.h library.*/
